Enable your users to take a quiz / questionnaire / self-assessment and receive feedback based upon the results

== Description ==

Create quizzes and questionnaires that your visitors can take and score themselves.

The data is not saved, only the user sees their results.

For example, you can have your users take a "You might be a Martian if..." or "See which planet you're from" quiz.

== Installation ==
If you have a single file (ending in ".zip"), then use the *Upload* method. If you have multiple files, use the *Files* method. If you're installing from WordPress.org directly, just hit the big 'Install Plugin' button.

= Upload =

 * From the plugins menu, choose 'add new', then select 'upload'
 * Navigate to where the .zip file is located and select it
 * Make sure to *activate* the plugin once it is installed
= Files =

 * Upload the entire directory (not just the files) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
